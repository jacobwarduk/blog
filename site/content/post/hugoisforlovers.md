Originally this post was entitled "Getting Started with Hugo", since that's the static site generator I'm using here and that is the title of [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)'s `Hello World` post.

Hugo is one of many static site generators I've briefly experimented with on my journey to find the one that just fits my needs, and it's the closest I've come.

Without going down the rabbit hole too deeply, every static site generator promises to be better than the last, and each one usually is - in some regard - but they're mostly the same, and bloated with features that I simply don't need.

Since I need an interesting side project to work on for [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/jacobwarduk/100-days-of-code), I think I'm going to go slightly out of my comfort zone (how else do you learn?) and try to build a static site generator of my own.

The feature set will be pretty simple, or maybe insanely complicated, I suppose I'll have to see as I go along.

But, if there's two things that I'm sure of it is these:


 • As a developer, I want to be able to develop using the technologies I choose, so that I can develop with/for the SSG with virtually no learning curve. 

 • As a writer, I want to be able to be able to write and publish with ease, so that there is as little friction as possible during in publishing process.
