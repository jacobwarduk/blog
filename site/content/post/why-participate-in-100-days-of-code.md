Despite it having been going on for a while (I think some people are on Round 3!), it wasn't until recently that I caught wind of the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode) challenge on Twitter, started by [Alexander Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away). When I saw the people participating - mostly members of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I thought to myself:

 > Fair play to all of these 'devs in training' making such a commitment to improving their skills with the goal of landing a job at the end of it*

But, despite having been a developer for a number of years now, it also made me contemplate my own commitment to learning.

I've read all the usual books - Bob Martin's [The Clean Coder](http://amzn.to/2xdiIt9), [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://amzn.to/2vMQcAL) by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas, [The Software Craftsman](http://amzn.to/2wqlRso) again by Bob Martin, and most recently [Becoming a Better Programmer](http://amzn.to/2xcW0RF). Each of which promote the act of self-learning and practice as being one of the most important things in being a programmer.

I never do any self-directed learning. All of the contracts I have worked in the last 2-3 years have been using technologies I already know inside out and don't even have to think about when bashing out the code all day.

It has finally hit me. **I need to do some learning myself**.

Despite my skillset being relevant now, what with the Front End Development ecosystem shifting so frequently and radically - seemingly daily - what will it be like in a year, 3 years, 5 years?

So I have [committed to the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge](https://github.com/jacobwarduk/100-days-of-code#-ive-joined-the-100daysofcode-challenge) and set my list of goals.

![My 100 Days of Code targets](/images/100-days-of-code-targets.png)

So far I am on day 23 and I have completed the majority of the underlying work on a Progressive Web Application (PWA) in ReactJS, something I had no knowledge of before, and getting a good understanding of Angular 4.

I try to [tweet my progress daily](https://twitter.com/jacobwarduk)...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bit of a slow <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash">#100DaysOfCode</a>, but at least I managed to create this little <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Markdown?src=hash">#Markdown</a> calendar for completed days <a href="https://t.co/w7MrekFeVW">https://t.co/w7MrekFeVW</a> <a href="https://t.co/U9U1QVzn5r">pic.twitter.com/U9U1QVzn5r</a></p>&mdash; Jacob Ward (@jacobwarduk) <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobwarduk/status/895033648960991233">August 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

...and being accountable in such a way also gives me the motivation to continue, even on days when I really can't be bothered.


Bottom line is **you don't have to be a new developer to participate in the challenge, even experienced developers can find value in it. I am, so why don't you?** [Start your #100DaysOfCode challenge here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
