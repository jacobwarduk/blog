To briefly recap what we learnt in [Part 1](http://jacobward.io/post/what-are-javascript-prototypes-part-1/), we know that objects have a prototype which is it's link to the prototype chain, we learnt about constructor calls, behaviour delegation, intrinsic objects, , and what some people might call "classes", "inheritance", and "polymorphism".

Today we're going to learn more about how objects are related by their prototype, and alternative ways of thinking about linking objects that don't conform to the 'class' style of Object Oritented Programming (OOP) we're probably all more used to.
