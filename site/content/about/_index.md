### 👨‍💻 About me

The astute reader will have noticed that I am a **Contract Front End & JavaScript Developer**. However, I suppose there is more to me than a job title, especially one which doesn't really describe what I _actually_ do.

#### So WTF do I _actually_ do?

I'm not a huge fan of the terms, but most of my time is split between **Front End Architecture**, **Front End Ops**, and on a good day some actual **Front End Development**. Without going into a ridiculous amount of detail, I spend my time...

 - architecting front end build, test, and deployment processes.
 - creating coding standards, pattern libraries, and style guides.
 - monitoring and ensuring code quality, and best practices.
 - writing clean JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

| 🕰    |   | How my typical day pans out                                           |
|-------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 06:00 |   | Wake up, take medication, smoke a few cigarettes                      |
| 06:15 |   | Jump in the shower and ponder any current issues                      |
| 06:30 |   | Get dressed in whatever I can find - never a proper shirt             |
| 06:45 |   | Leave for work and sit in M5 traffic, listening to BBC Radio 4        |
| 07:30 |   | Get to the office and start work *                                    |
| 13:00 |   | Spend my lunch break on personal projects and learning new stuff      |
| 14:00 |   | Get back to my desk and hopefully solve whatever I was working on     |
| 16:00 |   | Leave the office and sit in M5 traffic, listening to BBC Radio 4      |
| 17:00 |   | Get home and hopefully get in a cheeky hour of #100DaysOfCode         |
| 18:00 |   | The rest of the family get home and chaos ensues                      |
| 18:30 |   | Family time, dinner, a little TV if something good is on              |
| 22:00 |   | Sit in bed chatting to Gem about the day or reading latest book       |
| 23:00 |   | Go to sleep                                                           |


#### Do I do anything other than work?

Surprisingly, I do actually have a few interests outside of work.

### 🖥 About the site

I'm constantly learning and trying out new things. This is kind of a place for me to take notes on what I'm doing, share new things I've found out, basically just somewhere for me to have a little brain dump every now and then.

Sometimes you might see four posts in a row. Sometimes you might not see anything for a month.

If this site is still up, it means I'm alive somewhere because the domain registrar is still collecting the payment from my bank.

### 📚 About my book collection

I get a bit geeky about books. I love learning from books and have a massive library of technical and programming books.

Here's a selection of some of my favourites, most of which will have been used at some point as reference material for the posts you find here.

 > Whilst many of the resources here are available for free online, I would encourage you to support the authors by purchasing either the eBook or paperback versions, if you can afford it.

### 💻 About getting into web development

I got into web development whilst working as an SEO in the adult industry.

As I became more technically aware of SEO and how it's not just about having the right `h1`s and `meta` tags, I became more technically involved in the development of websites.

Around that time I decided to go back into education as an adult learner in my mid-twenties. Still doing a little bit of freelance work on the side to pay the bills.

I studied **Access to HE IT Software Development** at [Birmingham Metropolitan College](https://www.bmet.ac.uk/course/information-technology-access-to-higher-education/) and achieved distinctions in all six fields.

With the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/index.page) consistently being #1 in pretty much all guides, I then went on to study **General Engineering** there. After 2 years in Southampton, I decided to move back to Birmingham to finish off my studies.

During the summer break period, I was approached by [Cruise.co.uk](http://www.cruise.co.uk) to work as a Front End Developer for them. I hastily accepted the offer and never looked back.

Three years later and I'm a contractor in the industry, mostly recognised for my vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and AngularJS development skills. Yes, most businesses still use AngularJS. Businesses want to minimise risk, and AngularJS is a safe bet.

I also have experience with Node.js, Angular 2/4, ReactJS, and most of the other frameworks, libraries and tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

But, what I love most, is plain ol' vanilla JavaScript coding and keeping up to date with the [latest ECMAScript specs](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
