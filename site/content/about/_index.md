### 🖥 About the site

I'm constantly learning and trying out new things. This is kind of a place for me to take notes on what I'm doing, share new things I've found out, basically just somewhere for me to have a little brain dump every now and then.

Sometimes you might see four posts in a row. Sometimes you might not see anything for a month.

If this site is still up, it means I'm alive somewhere because the domain registrar is still collecting the payment from my bank.

### 📚 About my book collection

I get a but geeky about books. I love learning from books and have a massive library of technical and programming books.

Here's a selection of some of my favourites, most of which will have been used at some point as reference material for the posts you find here.

 > Whilst many of the resources here are available for free online, I would encourage you to support the authors by purchasing either the eBook or paperback versions, if you can afford it.

### 💻 About getting into web development

I got into web development whilst working as an SEO in the adult industry.

As I became more technically aware of SEO and how it's not just about having the right `h1`s and `meta` tags, I became more technically involved in the development of websites.

Around that time I decided to go back into education as an adult learner in my mid-twenties. Still doing a little bit of freelance work on the side to pay the bills.

I studied **Access to HE IT Software Development** at [Birmingham Metropolitan College](https://www.bmet.ac.uk/course/information-technology-access-to-higher-education/) and achieved distinctions in all six fields.

With the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/index.page) consistently being #1 in pretty much all guides, I then went on to study **General Engineering** there. After 2 years in Southampton, I decided to move back to Birmingham to finish off my studies.

During the summer break period, I was approached by [Cruise.co.uk](http://www.cruise.co.uk) to work as a Front End Developer for them. I hastily accepted the offer and never looked back.

Three years later and I'm a contractor in the industry, mostly recognised for my vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and AngularJS development skills. Yes, most businesses still use AngularJS. Businesses want to minimise risk, and AngularJS is a safe bet.

I also have experience with Node.js, Angular 4, ReactJS, and most of the other frameworks, libraries and tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

But, what I love most, is plain ol' vanilla JavaScript coding and keeping up to date with the [latest ECMAScript specs](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
