### 👨‍💻 About me

The astute reader will have noticed that I am a **Lead Front End & JavaScript Developer**. However, I suppose there is more to me than a job title, especially one which doesn't really describe what I _actually_ do.

#### So WTF do I _actually_ do?

I'm not a huge fan of the terms, but most of my time is split between **Front End Architecture**, **Front End Ops**, and on a good day some actual **Front End Development**. Without going into a ridiculous amount of detail, I spend my time...

 - Architecting front end build, test, and deployment processes.
 - Creating coding standards, pattern libraries, and style guides.
 - Monitoring and ensuring code quality, and best practices.
 - Writing clean JavaScript, HTML & CSS.


| 🕰    |   | How my typical day pans out                                           |
|-------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 06:00 |   | Wake up, take medication, smoke a few cigarettes                      |
| 06:15 |   | Try to workout in a vain attempt at being getting healthy             |
| 06:45 |   | Jump in the shower and ponder any current issues                      |
| 07:00 |   | Get dressed in whatever I can find - never a proper shirt             |
| 07:30 |   | Leave for work and sit in traffic, listening to BBC Radio 4           |
| 08:00 |   | Get to the office and start work *                                    |
| 13:00 |   | Spend my lunch break on personal projects and learning new stuff      |
| 14:00 |   | Get back to my desk and hopefully solve whatever I was working on     |
| 16:30 |   | Leave the office and sit in traffic, listening to BBC Radio 4         |
| 17:00 |   | Get home and hopefully get in an hour of coding on personal projects  |
| 18:00 |   | Dinner time!                                                          |
| 18:30 |   | A little TV if something good is on                                   |
| 22:00 |   | Read a chapter of whatever book I'm currently reading                 |
| 23:00 |   | Go to sleep                                                           |


#### Do I do anything other than work?

Surprisingly, I do actually have a few interests outside of work.

### 🖥 About the site

I'm constantly learning and trying out new things. This is kind of a place for me to take notes on what I'm doing, share new things I've found out, basically just somewhere for me to have a little brain dump every now and then.

Sometimes you might see four posts in a row. Sometimes you might not see anything for a month.

If this site is still up, it means I'm alive somewhere because the domain registrar is still collecting the payment from my bank.
