This very second I am sat on my sofa, drinking a can of Red Bull, smoking a B&H Gold cigarette, and typing this out.

I am waiting for my partner to get home, when the boys and ourselves shall be going for a jump at [AirHop](http://www.airhop-bristol.com/), followed by dinner at [ZaZa Bazaar](http://www.zazabazaar.com/).
